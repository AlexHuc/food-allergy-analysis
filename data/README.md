# Childhood Allergies: Prevalence, Demographics

Investigating Allergy Prevalence, Treatment Outcomes, and Patient Demographics

**Data Source**: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/44529#.Y7FI3NJBwUE)

#### **About this dataset**:
This dataset contains the power to help us better understand the prevalence and treatment outcomes of childhood allergies over an extended period of time. Not only does it publicize the number of individuals currently suffering from asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and food allergies through retrospective data as reported by healthcare providers - but it also features a set of columns which allow us to gain valuable insights into how these outcomes differ across different demographics such as gender, race and ethnicity. By further examining this data, we can start to recognize patterns in trends among the diagnosed cases - paving way for new treatments and prevention strategies that could prevent severe allergic reactions for many children all around the world

#### **How to use the dataset**
- Assess what kind of questions you want to answer using this data - do you want to focus on one particular type of allergy or analyze them together? Do you want a descriptive analysis or would an analysis that looks for correlations between conditions be more appropriate?
- Once you have determined your research question(s), identify what variables from the dataset are pertinent to your inquiry and assess any outliers that might need further investigation or filtering out during your analysis. Also consider any independent variables or confounding factors which might affect your results as well as any existing hypotheses related to the topic that might help guide your research project expectations
- Be aware of potential sources of bias when using self-reported healthcare provider information such as difficulties in disease identification (i.e allergies may be misdiagnosed). Additionally note that many allergy cases may go unreported/unrecorded due issues such as lack access/awareness about healthcare etc. A good way combat bias is by sample size - use largest possible datasets whenever available!
- Begin collecting relevant data from columns pertaining medical history (allergy diagnosis start & end date etc.), patient demographic information (gender factor ,ethnicity factor etc.), treatment trends & outcomes( first Asthma RX date , last asthma RX date , NUM asthma rx etc ). To get the most insights outta thisdata all these factors must be taken into account – if there isn’t enough evidence then explore other reliable sources too
- Structure & organize collected data so they can me easily accessed later – maybe create separate sheets/tabs with different categories i.e patient/treatment information OR create individual sheets for each subject depending upon how much info needs collecting .Designing formulaic functions will not only make life easier but critically save time & energy when it comes analyzing vast amounts data stored within workbook ! Remember larger sample sizes provide more

#### **Research Ideas**
- Use the dataset to identify risk factors or patterns in childhood allergies that can inform preventative and treatment measures.
- Investigate the correlation between demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and diagnosis or severity of childhood allergies by using cross-tabs or other statistical techniques on the data provided in this dataset.
- Analyze longitudinal trends in treatment outcomes for various types of childhood allergy, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and food allergy by comparing patient results over time (i.e., looking at pre-treatment diagnosis and post-treatment diagnoses)
